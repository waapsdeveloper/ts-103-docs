# Express.js Framework

Express.js is a fast, unopinionated, and minimalist web framework for Node.js. It provides robust features for building web and mobile applications, making it a popular choice for creating server-side applications with Node.js.

## Introduction

Express.js simplifies the process of building robust web applications with Node.js. It provides a thin layer of fundamental web application features without obscuring Node.js's core features, making it flexible for both small-scale and large-scale applications.

## Installation

To install Express.js, you need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.

### Step 1: Initialize a Node.js Project

Start by creating a new directory for your project and initialize a Node.js project:

```bash
mkdir my-express-app
cd my-express-app
npm init -y
```

### Step 2: Install Express

Next, install Express.js using npm:

```bash
npm install express
```

## Creating a Basic Express Server

Creating a basic server with Express.js is straightforward. Here's how you can set up a simple "Hello World" server:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

const port = 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

Run the server with:

```bash
node index.js
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser, and you should see "Hello, World!".

## Routing in Express

Routing refers to how an application’s endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests. Express makes routing easy and flexible.

### Basic Routing

```javascript
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Home Page');
});

app.get('/about', (req, res) => {
  res.send('About Page');
});
```

### Route Parameters

Route parameters allow you to capture values specified at certain positions in the URL.

```javascript
app.get('/user/:id', (req, res) => {
  res.send(`User ID: ${req.params.id}`);
});
```

### Handling Different HTTP Methods

Express allows you to handle different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) for the same route.

```javascript
app.post('/user', (req, res) => {
  res.send('POST request to /user');
});

app.put('/user/:id', (req, res) => {
  res.send(`PUT request to /user/${req.params.id}`);
});

app.delete('/user/:id', (req, res) => {
  res.send(`DELETE request to /user/${req.params.id}`);
});
```

## Middleware in Express

Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (`req`), the response object (`res`), and the next middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle.

### Example of Middleware

```javascript
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Time:', Date.now());
  next();
});
```

### Built-in Middleware

Express comes with several built-in middleware functions:

- `express.json()`: Parses incoming JSON requests.
- `express.urlencoded()`: Parses incoming requests with URL-encoded payloads.

```javascript
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
```

## Handling Requests and Responses

Express provides a robust API for handling HTTP requests and sending responses.

### Query Parameters

```javascript
app.get('/search', (req, res) => {
  const query = req.query.q;
  res.send(`Search query: ${query}`);
});
```

### Sending Responses

Express provides several methods to send responses:

```javascript
app.get('/text', (req, res) => {
  res.send('This is a text response');
});

app.get('/json', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'This is a JSON response' });
});
```

## Error Handling

Express allows you to define error-handling middleware by specifying four arguments: `err`, `req`, `res`, and `next`.

### Example of Error Handling Middleware

```javascript
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).send('Something broke!');
});
```

## Serving Static Files

Express can serve static files, such as images, CSS files, and JavaScript files, using the `express.static` middleware.

```javascript
app.use(express.static('public'));
```

Place your static files (e.g., `index.html`, `style.css`, etc.) inside the `public` directory, and Express will serve them automatically.

## Working with Databases

Express doesn’t come with built-in database integration, but you can easily connect to databases like MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc., using third-party packages.

### Example: Connecting to MongoDB

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/mydatabase', {
  useNewUrlParser: true,
  useUnifiedTopology: true
});

const db = mongoose.connection;
db.on('error', console.error.bind(console, 'connection error:'));
db.once('open', () => {
  console.log('Connected to MongoDB');
});
```

## Conclusion

Express.js is a powerful and flexible web framework for Node.js, offering a wide range of features for building web applications and APIs. With its minimalist approach, Express allows developers to create robust and scalable applications with ease. Whether you're building a simple website or a complex RESTful API, Express.js provides the tools you need to get the job done.
